SimpleCardTemplate - a simple card templating tool
---------------------------------------------------------

This is really a set of two utilities:

* SimpleCardTemplate.TemplateUtility

This is a simple Windows Forms app that, if you point it at an 
appropriate templates.js file in app.config, will let you visually set the regions of and properties for
rendering of card data on templates.

* SimpleCardTemplate.Console

This is an example of how you can use templates.js data created in 
SimpleCardTemplate.TemplateUtility to quickly render prototype cards to image files for printing.  It
assumes that the data is in a database, with the following mappings:

	templates.js property = database entity
	-----------------------------------------
	TemplateName = Name of Table in database
	Regions.RegionName = Name of field in database

If you prefer to get your data another way (XML document, Excel spreadsheet, OCR'd images of stone
tablets), you'll have to take the code in SimpleCardTemplate.Console and retrofit it (or rewrite it
entirely!) to suit your needs!

*** FAQ ***

* Will there be more support or features?

No, I wrote this in an evening so that I could quickly create templates for a playtest of a card game
that I'm making.  I don't anticipate improving it much further than it already is, and I don't apologize
for the lack of extensibility/code quality.  This was throwaway code that someone asked me to post for
their use: user beware!

* You have example templates, how do I put in my own?

Look in Config/templates.js - you'll see two existing examples.  Replace these with your own!
Don't worry about the properties other than name and image path - just put in janky defaults, and
use the TemplateUtility to populate them further.

Note that you will need base images for your templates.  I included janky example images for my 
janky example templates.  You'll want to replace these with your own.
